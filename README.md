# Video-Folder-Manager
So, This is a Folder Manager for Videos with sudo perms. The way it works is that, when you run the executable, it opens a console GUI where your asked some questions  regarding the folders you want to create. 

# How to run
If your on windows, download and run the executable normally.
If your on MacOS or Linux, get the source code, make sure you have python installed, then run the program in the terminal using:
- python3 your_file.py

Thanks for checking out my program.
